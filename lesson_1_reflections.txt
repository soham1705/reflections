How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	It took me a lot less time to find, as I was able to view specifically those areas which were different in the two files. It didn't require me to go through the entire files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	It would allow me to access earlier versions, which would enable me to fix bugs more efficiently.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	Pros:We have the freedom to choose when to commit, so our versions may make more sense.
	Cons:Forgetfulness,commits not being of the appropriate size

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Maybe because Git is used for bigger projects involving lots of interrelated files while Google Docs is used as a basic source of document storage.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	Git log: view history of all changes made in the repo
	Git diff: view differences between any two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Even if such changes are made, I know I would have the option to checkout to a previous version and undo the undesired change.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to use it to save my college assignments and projects.
