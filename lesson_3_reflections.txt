When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to preserve storage space; when I want to access it from any device; or,when I want to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be work which I have saved on my local system, that I am not ready or willing to share with others. Eg:-personal stuff, experimental changes etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks: Copying someone else's repository from GitHub into your own GitHub. Used when you want to make your own changes to that repo and share it to others.
	Clones: Copying someone else's repository from their local machine or GitHub, or your own GitHub, into your own local machine. Used when you want to make changes to repositories own your local machine
	Branches: Add new features that you want to keep independent of some other work on the same repository. Used when adding experimental features or working in collaboration

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It allows merging if conflicting changes are updated in the remote and the local machine.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Sharing files through pendrive,hard-disks etc. or Google Drive.
	Easier: No complicated steps like merges,forks,commits etc.
	Harder: No proper synchronisation of changes

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	Separate branch: Trying out an experimental feature that does not interfere with the main code. The main code remains intact.
	Main branch: There is no need to merge. Much simpler.
