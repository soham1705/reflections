When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to preserve storage space; when I want to access it from any device; or,when I want to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be work which I have saved on my local system, that I am not ready or willing to share with others. Eg:-personal stuff, experimental changes etc.
