When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to preserve storage space; when I want to access it from any device; or,when I want to share my work with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	There might be work which I have saved on my local system, that I am not ready or willing to share with others. Eg:-personal stuff, experimental changes etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks: Copying someone else's repository from GitHub into your own GitHub. Used when you want to make your own changes to that repo and share it to others.
	Clones: Copying someone else's repository from their local machine or GitHub, or your own GitHub, into your own local machine. Used when you want to make changes to repositories own your local machine
	Branches: Add new features that you want to keep independent of some other work on the same repository. Used when adding experimental features or working in collaboration
