What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git file is added in that repository.
	We need to do it to enable commits and other stuff that can be done with Git repositories.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	A staging area is an intermediate area where one can store the particular files to be committed. It offers the flexibility of choosing particular files to commit instead of committing the entire working directory at once.
